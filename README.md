  __HOWDY THERE, TRAVELLER!__

Well butter my biscuits — look what the cat done dragged in!
Kick off them boots and settle on down, we ‘bout to tumble deep
into the wild, whacky, moonshine-soaked world o' the hillfolk.


  __HOW TO RUN THIS HERE FINE PROGRAM__

Now don’t go fiddlin’ with no VS Code terminal, ya hear?
This here critter runs best from a good ol’-fashioned terminal!

To crank ‘er up:

  1. Give ‘er a good compilin’ with:
     _javac WordleGame.java_

  2. Then fire ‘er up with:
     _java WordleGame_

And hold onto yer britches — it’s fixin’ to get rowdy!
